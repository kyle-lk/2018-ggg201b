# Lab / Homework 1

Due Saturday, February 17th, at 12:01am (i.e 1 minute into Saturday).

To turn in, e-mail the document to Titus at ctbrown@ucdavis.edu with
'GGG 201b Lab HW1' in the title.

## Task: Call variants!

Run through variant calling with the SRR2584857 reads, but this time
use the reference located at:

    ~/2018-ggg201b/hw1/ecoli-rel606-ctb.fa.gz
    
after you do the git clone.

1. Record all the commands you run at the command line in a document.
   (A text file or a Word file is fine.)

2. At the bottom of the document, include the VCF file lines that are
*different* from the ones you generated in
[lab 3](../lab3-mapping-2/README.md).  Note that the previous VCF file
is available for download in [lab 3](../lab3-mapping-2/variants.vcf).
You can use `tail variants.vcf` to see the lines below the comments.

   You can ignore the comment lines; just copy/paste in the variant lines.

3. Send the document to Titus as above!
